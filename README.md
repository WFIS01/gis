# Welcome to GIS

GIS is Git-Stored Instructable Systems

They serve as a sort of API for websites, allowing you to develop from them

# How to use

1. Add to your websites code the "snippet.html" script, this will allow GIS functionality on your site using the receiver
2. Find a GIS you like, then inspect the code or get an AI to describe how the output will occur
3. Implement the GIS into your site and use the receiver via "gis.run()" and parse required parameters

# Rooting

GIS is designed to read only GIS's from this repository, if you create an issue you can add to this repository
However, if you want to test or develop on GIS, you may enjoy using GIS rooted

1. Go to your GIS-utilising site and open your web console
2. Run "gis.root()" then "gis.unlock()"

To configure the base URL used, use "gis.setBase()"
